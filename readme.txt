2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will it work on my theme too?**

YES! Whether your theme is free or premium, Private Area will seamlessly integrate with it.

**Can I switch themes? Will I lose content in the process?**

Your content will NOT be lost when switching themes, regardless of the one you choose to use.

**How does support work?**

Support on the plugin page on WordPress.org is completely voluntary. Feel free to post bug reports, or questions about the plugin functionality.

**What's the difference between a WordPress standard private page, and the ones created with this plugin?**

WordPress default private pages limit their access to admins and editors only. Private Area, on the contrary, allows you to define which roles have access to your pages.

**What's the difference between a WordPress standard password-protected page, and the ones created with this plugin?**

A password-protected page is indexed, as only its content is hidden from guests: instead of it, you'll see a form to input a password that will then unlock the actual page content.

A private page created with Private Area, instead, is automatically excluded from indexing.
